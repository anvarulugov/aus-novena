‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ<br>

[Official Site](https://lazyblocks.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=head) | [Documentation](https://lazyblocks.com/documentation/getting-started/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=head) | [GitHub](https://github.com/nk-crew/lazy-blocks)

Create custom blocks visually, add controls to your blocks using drag & drop, write blocks output using HTML or PHP code. You can create custom blocks as well as custom meta fields for specific post types. Furthermore, you are able to create post templates with predefined blocks for any post type.

### üöÄ Easy To Start

This everything you need to deploy your custom block in WordPress editor:

**1. Configure Custom Block** <br> Give a name to your custom block, set icon, category, etc.

**2. Add Controls** <br> Add control fields like simple text and complex image selectors.

**3. Write Output Code** <br> Output code for your custom block with HTML and PHP support.

### üåü Features

* Custom blocks with output code
* Custom blocks for posts meta fields
* Large set of predefined controls
* Show controls in block content / inspector
* Multiple output methods allowed
  * Custom PHP
  * Custom HTML + Handlebars

Lazy Blocks built by developers, for developers and gives you unlimited freedom to create custom blocks. Furthermore, there are PHP filters and actions to customize every part of your custom blocks from the backend. Possibility to use PHP and theme templates system.

Every UI part should be intuitive for simple custom blocks, but if you want to create something more complex, you may be required to [read our extensive documentation](https://lazyblocks.com/documentation/getting-started/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=developers).

## Installation

### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don‚Äôt need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Lazy Blocks, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type ‚ÄúLazy Blocks‚Äù and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù.

### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our Lazy Blocks plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
